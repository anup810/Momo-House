Briefly explain how design principles such as proximity, contrast, typography, etc. are considered in your
website’s design

Proximity: This principle involves grouping related items together to create visual harmony and coherence. In this website, proximity can be applied by grouping related elements such as navigation menus, content blocks, and buttons near each other to help users navigate the site more easily.

Contrast: Contrast involves using differences in color, size, shape, and other visual elements to create visual interest and highlight important information. This website uses contrast to create focal points, highlight key messages, and improve readability.

Typography: Typography is arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing. This website design uses typography to create a visual hierarchy, emphasize important information, and improve readability.
